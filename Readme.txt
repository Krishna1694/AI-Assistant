# Lumos - Your Personal Voice Assistant

**Lumos** is a Jarvis-inspired, AI-powered voice assistant built to help you with daily tasks through speech recognition and speech synthesis. It integrates powerful machine learning models for speech-to-text transcription and offers voice-based interactions with various commands.

## Current Capabilities

- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribes audio input into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into speech using pyttsx3.
- **Noise Reduction**: Applies noise reduction to recorded audio for clearer voice input.
- **Basic Commands**: Handles a set of voice commands, including telling the time, opening websites, and exiting the program.
- **Continuous Listening**: Continuously listens for commands, enabling hands-free interaction.

## Present Features

- **Time & Date Commands**:
  - "What is the time?"
  - "What is today's date?"

- **Website Opening**:
  - "Open Google"
  - "Open YouTube"

- **Exit Command**:
  - "Exit"
  - "Stop"
  - "Shutdown"

- **Noise Reduction**: Automatically reduces background noise during recording to improve speech recognition accuracy.
